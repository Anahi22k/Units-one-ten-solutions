U - Understand
    1. Is the mood variable expected to be updated within the function itself?
    2. Are there any restrictions on what can be assigned to the mood variable?

P - Plan
    1) Create a new function by writing a function signature
    2) Create a variable to store the current mood emoji
    3) Print "Today's mood:" followed by the value of the variable
    3) Call the created function
